# Amortization-Calculator
Create an amortization table with payment and balance information

The program asks for a loan amount, the annual interest rate and the number of months that the loan will be scheduled for.
It then calculates the payment amount, which will be the same for each month.
The user then has the option of viewing the data, at which point it can be observed that the interest amount paid decreases and the principal amounts increase as subsequent payments are made.
This continues until the balance reaches zero.
